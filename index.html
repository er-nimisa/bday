              <h2>Once upon a class, there was us</h2>
              <p>
                Somewhere in a normal school day, there was a Web Dev training
                class. On one side of the room were the big brothers and
                sisters from class 12, ready to teach. On the other side were
                the juniors from class 10, eyes full of curiosity and a little
                bit of nervousness.
              </p>
              <p>
                In that room, between HTML tags and CSS colors, there was a
                girl named <strong>Nimisa</strong>. She listened carefully,
                tried hard, smiled softly, and without even knowing it, she
                turned that simple training into something unforgettable.
              </p>
              <p>
                At first, they called each other brother and sister – not by
                blood, but by bond. She didn’t know it yet, but in someone’s
                heart, that classroom was no longer just a class. It was the
                place where a story quietly began.
              </p>

          </article>

            <div class="page-content">
              <h2>The “teacher” who noticed everything</h2>
              <p>
                There was a boy in that Web Dev batch, standing on the “teacher”
                side, pretending to be calm and serious. But inside, every time
                he saw <strong>Nimisa</strong> focus on the screen or ask a
                doubt, his heart quietly smiled like a shy sun behind the
                clouds.
              </p>
              <p>
                He noticed the small things: the way she tried to understand
                every concept, the way she didn’t give up easily, the way her
                presence made the class feel lighter, like a soft song playing
                in the background while everyone else only heard noise.
              </p>
              <p>
                Day by day, between “brother–sister” jokes and shared moments,
                something gentle began to grow. Slowly, quietly, he realised
                the universe had hidden a gift in that classroom. Not in the
                computers, not in the projector, but sitting quietly in the
                class 10 row. And that gift was her.

              <h2>Bhadra 17 (or 18): when he chose her</h2>
              <p>
                Time kept moving. Brother–sister by bond slowly turned into
                something deeper – a feeling that didn’t fit in just one word.
                One day around <strong>Bhadra 17 or 18</strong>, his heart
                finally spoke the truth it had been holding for so long.
              </p>
              <p>
                On that day, he looked at his girl from class 10 and chose her
                not just as a student, not just as a sister by bond, but as the
                one his heart wanted to walk beside. He didn’t just say words –
                he <strong>proposed</strong> his feelings and trusted the sky
                with the answer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, as she moves toward her <strong>SEE</strong>, books open
                and nights getting longer, one thing stays the same: he believes
                in her the way the moon believes in the night sky – calmly,
                fully, without any doubt. No exam, no mark, no result can change
                how proud he already is of her.

                  The way her name, <strong>Nimisa</strong>, feels like a warm
                  hug every time he says it, whether in class or in his heart.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Her courage to learn, even when topics feel confusing or
                  heavy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The way she listens, asks, and tries again, turning doubt into
                  understanding.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Her soft heart that still finds kindness for others, even
                  while she is stressed herself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The way she makes him want to be better – as a person, as a
                  “teacher”, as someone who stands beside her.
                </li>
                <li>
                  And most of all, the simple fact that she is <em>her</em> –
                  beautifully, wonderfully, irreplaceably <strong>her</strong>.

                Dear <strong>Nimisa</strong>, if I could wrap love in pages, it
                would look like this – simple, honest, and full of you.
              </p>
              <p>
